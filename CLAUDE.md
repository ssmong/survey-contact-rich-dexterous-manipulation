Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Code Style

- Python 3.10, type hints on all function signatures.
- Formatter: `ruff format`. Linter: `ruff check`.
- Imports: stdlib → third-party → local, separated by blank lines. One import per line.
- Naming: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes, `UPPER_SNAKE` for constants.
- No wildcard imports (`from x import *`).
- Docstrings: one-line only, Google style, only when the function name alone is not self-explanatory.
- Config files: YAML. Use `OmegaConf` or plain `yaml.safe_load`, not Hydra.
- Scripts must be runnable standalone (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
- Paths: use `pathlib.Path`, not string concatenation.
- No silent failures. Raise exceptions instead of returning defaults or falling back quietly. If something fails, it must be loud.
- Virtual env: always `source .venv/bin/activate` before running Python.
- Package manager: use `uv` (`uv pip install`, `uv add`, etc.). Do not use bare `pip`.

## 6. Decision Log

- Read `docs/plan/decisions.md` at session start to understand prior decisions before working.
- When a technical decision is made during the session (adoption, rejection, pivot), append it to `docs/plan/decisions.md` at the end of the session.
- Format: date, decision title, background, rationale. Newest entries first.

## 7. Unfamiliar APIs

**When using an API for the first time, or when repeated errors occur with a familiar-seeming API, always verify against the actual source code or official docs before writing code.**

- Before writing ANY config or setup code, find a working example in the same codebase and copy its pattern first. Then adapt.
- Read the class/function definition in the source. Check parameter names, types, and default values.
- Do not guess parameter names or import paths from memory or training data.
- If a parameter causes a TypeError or AttributeError, check the source — do not try random alternatives.
- When debugging a runtime error, check if the architectural approach is wrong before investigating the error message literally.
- When a dimension mismatch or unexpected value appears, ALWAYS investigate before dismissing. "The framework handles it" is not an acceptable answer without verification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
